# 📊 Web Scraping & EDA: Largest U.S. Companies by Revenue

This is a mini data project where I scraped a table from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue) listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.

## 📌 Project Overview

- ✅ **Web Scraping** using `pandas.read_html()` to extract the company revenue data from Wikipedia
- ✅ **Data Cleaning** (splitting city/state, fixing data types)
- ✅ **EDA**: revenue trends, revenue growth analysis, correlation heatmaps, diverging bar charts
- ✅ **Visualization** using Seaborn and Matplotlib
